# DreamKing
This is a game, which my friend and I made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7"> Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1</a>  
The theme was <b>IT IS NOT REAL</b>  
It took us a week to make this from scratch, while my friend's role was 3D modeling and level design, I was doing all the coding and voice lines<sub>(voice lines are AI-generated :D)</sub>  
Our inspiration was the very popular game at the time <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/">Jump King</a>, however we decided it would be 3D and instead of "<b>the Smoking Hot Babe</b>" we have "<b>The Legendary Pickle</b>", which you are so desperetly trying to reach<sub>(because you are not horny today, just hungry)</sub>  
You can play the game <a href="https://vulpesdev.itch.io/dream-king">here</a><sub>(you can play it even in your browser)</sub>

# Description
You wake up feeling hungry for a pickle! In your way to the kitchen something strange happens and you find yourself in an unknown place. The only way for you to get the pickle you were searching for is to jump and climb the mysterious tower!
